# Problem_Solving_Mancala_Game
This project models and solves the Mancala (Awalé) game using adversarial search techniques. The game is formulated as a state-space problem and implemented in Python. A Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning is used to enable the computer to play optimally against a human player, based on a heuristic evaluation of the game state.
